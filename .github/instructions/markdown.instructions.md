When writing markdown ALWAYS obey these style guidelines

- leave a blank line after headings
- leave a blank line before and after code blocks
- leave a blank line before and after lists
- files should end with a single newline character - no more, no less
- no bare urls, use markdown syntax for urls
- no trailing spaces at the end of lines, a line cannot be only spaces
- nested list items should indent using 2 spaces per level
