**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Scope**: User Stories 1-3 (Logging, Medication Management, Medical Passport)  
**Classification**: Internal Security Assessment  

## Executive Summary

This threat review assesses security risks in the SaaS Medical Tracker application handling personal health information (PHI). The application implements basic security controls including JWT authentication, user isolation, input validation, and SQLite-based data storage. Key risks identified include authentication bypass, data exposure, injection attacks, and privacy violations. Recommendations focus on strengthening authentication mechanisms, enhancing input validation, implementing proper encryption, and establishing audit logging.

## System Overview

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript (client-side rendering)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLModel/SQLAlchemy (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite (file-based, single node)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens (HS256, local validation)
- **Deployment**: Containerized (development/staging), local file storage

### Data Classification
- **PHI (Protected Health Information)**: Medical conditions, symptoms, medication logs, doctor information
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: User email addresses, names, contact information
- **Authentication Data**: JWT tokens, session information
- **Operational Data**: Logs, metrics, performance data

## Threat Model

### Assets

- [ ] Regular dependency updates and security patching
- [ ] Dependency version pinning and verification
- [ ] Software bill of materials (SBOM)

## Compliance Considerations

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **Administrative Safeguards**: Access controls, assigned security responsibilities
- **Physical Safeguards**: Workstation security, media controls
- **Technical Safeguards**: Access controls, audit controls, integrity controls, transmission security

**Current Gap Analysis**:
- ❌ Encryption at rest not implemented
- ❌ Audit logging insufficient for compliance
- ❌ Access controls need role-based enhancements
- ❌ Business associate agreements needed for deployment

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary health data
- **Right to Erasure**: Implement data deletion capabilities
- **Data Portability**: Export user data in structured format
- **Breach Notification**: 72-hour notification procedures

**Current Gap Analysis**:
- ❌ Data retention policies not defined
- ❌ User data export functionality missing
- ❌ Data deletion/anonymization procedures needed
- ❌ Consent management mechanisms required

## Security Controls Assessment

### Implemented Controls
✅ **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication  
✅ **Authorization**: User-scoped data access  
✅ **Input Validation**: Pydantic schema validation  
✅ **SQL Injection Protection**: SQLModel ORM usage  
✅ **HTTPS**: Encrypted communication in production  
✅ **Structured Logging**: Centralized log management  

### Missing/Incomplete Controls
❌ **Rate Limiting**: No API rate limits implemented  
❌ **Session Management**: No token rotation or timeout  
❌ **Encryption at Rest**: SQLite files unencrypted  
❌ **Audit Logging**: Insufficient access event logging  
❌ **Error Handling**: Potential information leakage  
❌ **CSRF Protection**: No anti-CSRF tokens
