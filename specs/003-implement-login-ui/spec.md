# Feature Specification: Login UI & Conditional Access

**Feature Branch**: `003-implement-login-ui`  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "implement login ui with conditional display, user identity in top bar, logout control"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-25

- Q: What auth token transport/storage method will be used? → A: Secure HTTP-only SameSite cookie carrying JWT set/cleared by backend.

## User Story 1 - Access Gate & Login (Priority: P1)

An unauthenticated visitor reaches the application and is presented with a combined login/register experience; upon successful login they are redirected seamlessly to their dashboard without seeing protected content beforehand.

**Why this priority**: Without controlled access and the ability to authenticate, the rest of the application delivers no personal value. This is the foundational capability enabling all subsequent tracking features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the root URL in a fresh session, performing a login with valid credentials, and verifying redirect and absence of protected data pre-auth. This slice alone yields a usable pathway for existing users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with valid credentials is logged out, **When** they submit correct email & password, **Then** they see the dashboard landing and their session is active.
2. **Given** a logged-out user visits a protected deep link (e.g., /dashboard), **When** the app evaluates auth state, **Then** they are shown the login/register interface (not partial dashboard flashes).
3. **Given** an invalid credential attempt, **When** the user submits the form, **Then** a non-technical error message appears (e.g., "Check your details and try again") without revealing whether email exists.
4. **Given** network failure during login, **When** form is submitted, **Then** user sees a retry guidance message and can re-attempt without losing typed data.

## User Story 2 - Registration & First Entry (Priority: P2)

A new visitor can create an account from the same interface (toggle or tab) and, after successful registration, is automatically logged in and advanced to the dashboard with a confirmation banner acknowledging first access.

**Why this priority**: Enables acquisition and conversion of new users; reduces friction by avoiding separate flows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting from a logged-out state, switching to registration, completing required fields, and confirming automatic login and dashboard arrival.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor without an account, **When** they submit valid registration info, **Then** an account is created and they land on the dashboard authenticated.
2. **Given** missing required registration fields, **When** submit is pressed, **Then** inline field validation states appear and submit is blocked until corrected.
3. **Given** a password not meeting minimum strength rule, **When** they attempt registration, **Then** they receive guidance to improve it (no technical jargon).
4. **Given** an email already in use, **When** user tries to register, **Then** a generic conflict message appears without enumerating existing accounts.

## User Story 3 - Authenticated Top Bar Identity & Logout (Priority: P3)

An authenticated user always sees a top bar element showing their display identifier (first name or obfuscated email) plus an accessible control to log out, clearing session and returning them to the login/register screen without residual protected UI flicker.

**Why this priority**: Reinforces trust (confirmation of signed-in state) and provides necessary session control for privacy/security.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in, verifying identity token presence in top bar, triggering logout, and asserting removal of protected elements and session invalidation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated session, **When** the dashboard loads, **Then** the top bar displays the user identity and a logout action.
2. **Given** an authenticated session, **When** logout is triggered, **Then** session state is cleared and login/register interface replaces dashboard immediately.
3. **Given** slow network on logout, **When** user clicks logout, **Then** a transient progress indicator appears and blocks duplicate submissions.
4. **Given** a failure response during logout, **When** the action is attempted, **Then** the user is informed and can retry; identity remains visible until success.

## Edge Cases

- User loads a protected route in multiple tabs: all should uniformly redirect to login if not authenticated (no partial protected render).
- Stale session cookie: UI should detect invalid session and present login without confusing error spam.
- Lost network after form completion: form retains entered values for recovery.
- Rapid double-click on submit: second attempt ignored while first in-flight (prevents duplicate server calls).
- Logout while a background data fetch is mid-flight: fetch completion must not resurrect protected UI artifacts.
- Identity with very long email/local part: top bar should truncate gracefully with tooltip.
- Mobile viewport: login/register layout stacks accessibly; no horizontal scroll.

## Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST present a unified access screen (login + register options) to any unauthenticated visitor requesting protected content.
- **FR-002**: System MUST redirect authenticated users who visit the root or login screen directly to their dashboard without manual action.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a registration flow collecting minimally: email, password, and (optional) display name.
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce password strength (assumed: minimum length 10, includes at least two character classes) and provide human-friendly guidance when unmet.
- **FR-005**: System MUST display generic error feedback for failed login attempts without indicating whether email exists.
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve entered form data when a network or validation error occurs (no full form reset).
- **FR-007**: System MUST visibly indicate in-progress state during login, registration, and logout actions and suppress duplicate submissions.
- **FR-008**: System MUST render the authenticated user identity (display name or masked email form: local part truncated to 3 chars + ellipsis) in the top bar.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide an accessible logout control (keyboard focusable, proper ARIA labeling) that clears session state and returns user to access screen.
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent protected dashboard components from flashing prior to auth decision (guard completes before render).
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle stale/invalid session tokens gracefully by clearing them and presenting the access screen without error cascade.
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure mobile layout of access screen and top bar remains usable without horizontal scrolling (viewport width ≥320px).
- **FR-013**: System MUST truncate overly long identity strings in top bar while offering full value on hover/focus (tooltip or accessible description).
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide a success acknowledgement on first registration (banner or inline confirmation) visible for at least 5 seconds or until dismissed.
- **FR-015**: System MUST expose distinct state selectors for testing (data-testids for form fields, submit buttons, identity display, logout control).
- **FR-016**: System MUST rely on an HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite cookie (backend-set) for JWT transport; frontend MUST NOT access token value directly and MUST derive auth state via protected API responses.

Assumptions applied (see Assumptions section) for unspecified details; no critical clarifications required beyond defaults.

## Key Entities

- **User**: Represents an account capable of authentication; attributes (conceptual) include: email, password (stored securely), optional display name, created timestamp. Related to session(s).
- **Session**: Represents an authenticated interaction context; attributes: user reference, issued time, expiry policy, validity flag.
- **Access Screen State**: Transient representation of UI mode (login vs register), form field values, validation states, submission status, error messages.

## Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 90% of successful logins complete (from initial screen load to dashboard display) in ≤ 4 seconds under nominal network conditions.
- **SC-002**: 95% of new user registrations complete (submit to dashboard visible) in ≤ 6 seconds.
- **SC-003**: 0 unhandled client errors logged during login, registration, logout journeys in QA runs.
- **SC-004**: Accessibility score ≥ 90 for access screen and dashboard top bar (independent audits).
- **SC-005**: Critical path bundle size increase ≤ +25KB gzipped (identity & access UI additions) compared to baseline.
- **SC-006**: Failed login attempts present feedback within ≤ 1 second in 95% of cases (excluding deliberate network outage tests).
- **SC-007**: Duplicate submission prevention effective: no more than 1 request per user action for 99% of rapid double-click test cases.
- **SC-008**: Mobile viewport usability: all interactive elements maintain minimum 44px hit area and no horizontal scroll at 320px width.
- **SC-009**: Polish phase full regression: 100% of existing automated test suites (backend pytest, frontend Vitest, Playwright e2e) re-run green with ≥ baseline coverage and no new critical accessibility violations (axe) introduced.

## Assumptions

- Authentication method: standard email + password (industry default); SSO out of scope for this slice.
- Password strength baseline: length ≥10 and mixture of at least two character classes (letters, digits, symbols) deemed reasonable default.
- Display name fallback: if absent, masked email used.
- Session expiry & retention defined elsewhere; handling of stale tokens limited to UI clearing and redirect. JWT delivered via HTTP-only cookie; no localStorage persistence.
- Registration requires email uniqueness; conflicts produce generic error.
- Tooltip accessibility handled via native title or ARIA description—implementation style unspecified here.

## Success Validation Approach

User acceptance tests and synthetic performance measurements against flows for login, registration, and logout; structured accessibility audit performed; bundle diff analyzed post-build. Console monitored during scripted e2e for error presence. During Polish phase, execute full regression: all backend/ frontend/e2e suites and accessibility scans must pass (SC-009) and coverage must not drop below pre-feature baselines.

## Risks

- Potential confusion if combined login/register screen not clearly differentiated: mitigated with clear toggle labels.
- Overly strict password rules may reduce conversion; monitor registration abandonment.
- Masking logic might over-truncate short emails; ensure minimum visible characters (≥3 + domain).

## Out of Scope

- Multi-factor authentication.
- Social / SSO providers.
- Password reset and account recovery flows.
- Profile editing beyond identity display.

## Open Questions

None requiring clarification—defaults chosen as per assumptions.
