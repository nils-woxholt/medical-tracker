# Feature Specification: User Authentication (Login & Registration)

**Feature Branch**: `002-login-functionality-add`  
**Created**: 2025-10-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "login functionality - add a login page to the current site - users can login or register - create a demo user that can be used to test with - make sure that the session always knows who the current user is"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Return User Logs In (Priority: P1)

An existing user visits the application, navigates (or is redirected) to the login page, enters valid credentials, and gains access to authenticated features with their identity reflected across the session (e.g., personalized dashboard header shows their name).

**Why this priority**: Core gateway to any personalized or protected functionality; without it, other flows (medication tracking, logs) cannot associate data to a person.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a user record beforehand, performing a login attempt, and verifying post-login state (identity visible, authorized content accessible, unauthorized content blocked prior to login).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a registered user with valid credentials, **When** they submit correct credentials, **Then** they are signed in and see an authenticated landing experience showing their display identifier.
2. **Given** a not-logged-in state, **When** the user attempts to access a protected page, **Then** they are redirected to the login page and after successful login returned to the originally requested location.
3. **Given** a registered user, **When** they enter an incorrect password, **Then** an error message explains credentials are invalid without revealing which field was wrong and the user remains logged out.

---

### User Story 2 - New User Registers (Priority: P2)

A visitor without an account chooses to register, provides required profile information (minimal: email & password plus optional display name), and upon successful registration is treated as authenticated without requiring a second manual login.

**Why this priority**: Enables growth and first-time user conversion; essential for obtaining unique identity and enabling subsequent login flows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting a unique email to registration, verifying user record creation, immediate authenticated session, and ability to access protected pages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an email not previously registered, **When** the user submits valid registration details, **Then** an account is created and the user is considered logged in.
2. **Given** an email already registered, **When** a registration attempt reuses that email, **Then** the system rejects the attempt with a non-revealing message indicating the email is already in use and suggests login instead.
3. **Given** a password that fails minimum criteria, **When** the user submits the form, **Then** the system displays clear validation guidance and no account is created.

---

### User Story 3 - Session Persistence & Demo Access (Priority: P3)

An authenticated user (real or demo) remains recognized across page reloads and standard navigation until they explicitly log out or their session times out. A special "demo user" path allows quick evaluation without full registration while clearly limiting data persistence or scope.

**Why this priority**: Session continuity is required for usability; a demo user lowers friction for evaluation/testing.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in (or using demo), refreshing pages, navigating protected routes, and verifying continuity plus proper cleanup upon logout.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they refresh any protected page, **Then** they remain authenticated and identity is still displayed.
2. **Given** an authenticated user idle past the inactivity timeout, **When** they next interact with a protected endpoint, **Then** they are prompted to re-authenticate and original action is safe-handled (not executed with expired session).
3. **Given** a visitor selecting the demo access option, **When** they proceed, **Then** they receive a limited, clearly labeled session without needing to supply credentials.
4. **Given** a demo session, **When** they attempt privileged actions outside demo scope, **Then** they are prompted to register to proceed.

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- User attempts to login with an email that does not exist: generic invalid credentials message returned.
- Rapid repeated failed login attempts (≥5 consecutive within any rolling window) cause immediate account lock for 15 minutes; subsequent attempts during lock show generic invalid credentials message and do not extend lock duration.
- Registration form submitted with leading/trailing whitespace in email (should normalize) and duplicate after normalization.
- Session cookie/token manually deleted mid-session then user navigates: system treats next request as unauthenticated and prompts login without crashing.
- Demo user simultaneous usage by multiple visitors should not leak private data across visitors (stateless or isolated context required conceptually).
- User logs out in one tab; another open tab still shows authenticated UI until next protected request triggers re-check (graceful UI reconciliation on fetch failure).
- Password at minimum boundary (e.g., exactly 8 chars) accepted; below boundary rejected with clear messaging.
- Mixed-case email used at login must match case-insensitive stored canonical form.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a dedicated login page accessible from unauthenticated state and via a consistent navigation entry.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow new users to register with minimally: email and password; optional display name captured when provided.
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate email format and uniqueness (case-insensitive) at registration time before creating an account.
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce password rules: minimum 8 characters, includes at least one letter and one number (assumed baseline standard).
- **FR-005**: System MUST authenticate users using email + password credentials.
- **FR-006**: System MUST establish an authenticated session after successful login or registration so that subsequent requests identify the current user.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a visible indicator of the current authenticated user's identity (e.g., display name or email fragment) on protected pages.
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent access to protected resources when user is not authenticated, redirecting or prompting login instead of exposing content.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a logout action that terminates the user's authenticated session and returns them to a public state.
- **FR-010**: System MUST support a "demo user" access path that grants a limited session without registration and clearly labels limitations.
- **FR-011**: System MUST treat demo user actions as real user data.
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist session across standard navigation and page reloads until logout or timeout occurs.
- **FR-013**: System MUST invalidate sessions after 30 minutes of user inactivity (rolling idle timeout) and require re-authentication on next protected action.
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide user feedback for failed login attempts without indicating whether email or password was incorrect.
- **FR-015**: System MUST lock an account after 5 consecutive failed login attempts (counter resets on successful login) for 15 minutes; during lock, further attempts are rejected with a generic error and no user enumeration; all events are audit logged.
- **FR-016**: System SHOULD automatically focus the first input field (email) on the login and registration pages for accessibility/usability.
- **FR-017**: System SHOULD preserve originally requested protected route and navigate there after successful login.
- **FR-018**: System DOES NOT NEED TO clearly distinguish demo session UI
- **FR-019**: System MUST ensure that once logged out, revisiting a protected resource without re-authentication is not allowed.
- **FR-020**: System MUST record audit entries for registration, login success, login failure, logout, and demo session initiation events (conceptual requirement, no implementation detail).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Represents an individual account; attributes include unique email (normalized), password credential (securely stored conceptually), optional display name, creation timestamp, last login timestamp, and status (active/locked).
- **Session**: Represents an authenticated continuity context mapping a user to subsequent interactions; includes user reference, creation time, last activity time, expiry time.
- **Demo Session**: A specialized session variant associated with a shared or synthetic user identity flagged as non-persistent/limited; may have constraints on data creation scope.

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A new (unregistered) visitor can register and reach an authenticated landing view in ≤ 60 seconds median.
- **SC-002**: A returning user can complete a successful login (form load to authenticated landing view) in ≤ 20 seconds median.
- **SC-003**: 100% of protected routes deny access when unauthenticated during testing (no accidental exposure).
- **SC-004**: ≥ 95% of interactive authentication form submissions produce clear, actionable validation or success feedback without page reload confusion (measured in UX review / test scripts).
- **SC-005**: Demo access path allows reaching an authenticated demo state in ≤ 10 seconds median from initial visit.
- **SC-006**: Session timeout triggers re-authentication prompt reliably after configured inactivity period in 100% of sampled test cases.
- **SC-007**: Accessibility audit for login & registration pages achieves score ≥ 90 (contrast, labels, focus order).
- **SC-008**: No more than 1% of successful login attempts are followed by an unexpected logout within 5 minutes (session persistence reliability).
- **SC-009**: Failed login attempts produce no user enumeration leakage (messages identical) in 100% of tested mixed inputs.
- **SC-010**: Rate limiting engages after defined failed attempt threshold in 100% of simulated brute force scenarios.

## Assumptions

- Email + password chosen as default authentication method (industry norm) without external SSO for initial scope.
- Password policy kept minimal for faster onboarding; can be expanded later.
- Demo user data either ephemeral or clearly segregated; persistence specifics deferred to implementation design but isolation is required functionally.
- 30-minute inactivity timeout confirmed as accepted standard.
- Lockout / throttling strategy (counts and durations) requires confirmation to balance security vs. usability.

## Out of Scope

- Password reset / forgotten password flows (to be specified separately).
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) or secondary verification methods.
- Social / third-party login (OAuth / SSO providers).
- Account deletion / data export workflows.
- Email verification step prior to first login (assumed deferred; registration grants immediate access).
- Administrative user role management or permission tiers (single end-user role only plus demo context).
- Session revocation across all devices (logout affects current session only).
- Advanced security analytics (anomaly detection, geo-velocity checks).

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-19

- Q: What inactivity timeout duration should apply before session invalidation (FR-013)? → A: 30 minutes.
- Q: What failed login protection strategy & thresholds (FR-015 & related edge case)? → A: Hard lock after 5 consecutive failures; 15-minute lockout; counter resets on success; attempts during lock return generic error.

All previously identified clarifications are now resolved.
